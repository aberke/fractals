### Why?

I love fractals.  I also love math and am working on a coloring book that teaches its audience <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">group theory</a>, and needed to draw some fractals in javascript.  It was harder than I thought, and led down a rabbit hole that seemed worthy of a webpage.  I wanted to be able to share the javascript code I wrote so that others did not later have the same troubles as I.


### Development

Setting up development:

- Clone repo
- Install dev dependencies `$ npm install`

Lint Javascript with gulp:
- `$ gulp lint`
